# SourceHut

I'm not a fan of SourceHut,
[in particluar their lack of https git push](https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss/%3Ce40c1fd79b4f211174cdeb05ad598cbe1f894b4c.camel@swsnr.de%3E#%3CCH57CFADV9HW.39IEI4RCUNEZ7@taiga%3E)
and [Drew DeVault's general aggressiveness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31561822)
(his mastodon (over at `cmpwn.com`) used to have more rants and trolling but got nuked.)

But I wish them well in response to their [news about their recent hardship](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-06-04-status-and-plans/).
My preferences aside, things like [DDoS](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/)
or logistics nightmare is not something anyone should experience.
