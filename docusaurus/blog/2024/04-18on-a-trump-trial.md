I find it pretty hilarious to see US people making a fuss about the idea of former presidents standing in a criminal trials -- We've done this before, and we've _delivered_ those criminals justice and sent them to jail. (Albeit wrong decision to pardon them has been made...)

Being an ex-president does not make you immune from your crimes, and it should not be made so.
