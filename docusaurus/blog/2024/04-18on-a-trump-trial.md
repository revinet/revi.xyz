# On a Trump trial

I find it pretty hilarious to see US people making a fuss about the idea of former
presidents standing in a criminal trials -- We've done this before, and we've
_delivered_ those criminals justice and sent them to jail.
(Albeit wrong decision to pardon them has been made...)

Being an ex-president does not make you immune from your crimes,
and it should not be made so.
