# Democracy on the verge of collapse

Since the December the 3rd, we are on the verge of democracy collapsing, with the insurgents still seating at National Assembly and the Office of the President. Last attempt to 'forgive them' and seek unity failed with this.

Only solution now is showing them the full force of consequences, with enforcing the statute. (Insurrection leaders are punished by death penalty or life sentence.) Fuck you, and go straight to jail for rest of your lives.

Any and all Armed Forces personnel should also be punished as if they were low-rank insurgents, they should have known that following unlawful orders are punishable by law and refused to follow the order. They did not, and they shall be purged as disloyal to the Constitution. Claiming 'disobeying is a criminal offense', however due to past coup insurgents saying same, law stipulates 'disobeying /legitimate/ order' is punishable, and unlawful orders are NOT legitimate. So, again, fuck you, too.
