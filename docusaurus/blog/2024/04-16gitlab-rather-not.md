I'd rather use Forgejo rather than GitLab. Like, the feature [GitLab charges for US$348 per year per person](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#scoped-labels)[^1] is... [whopping free in forgejo](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/labels/#scoped-labels).

[^1]: logic is Premium US$29\*12(months). The pricing $29 is 'when billed annually'. I skimmed the page to figure out the true monthly billing pricing but couldn't find it at the moment.
