# Usage of arc

I'm not really a big fan of `arc`, but I want to preserve
'one idea is one commit' method, and I don't want to install yet another
server-side software (I mean, `gerrit`) and especially not surrender to
GitHub/GitLab style of 'one idea is one branch' model,
so I'm sort of stuck here with arc.

[agit-workflow in forgejo](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/) looks
better than GitHub/GitLab, but I'm yet to test them substantially.
