I'm not really a big fan of `arc`, but I want to preserve 'one idea is one commit' method, and I don't want to install entirely new server-side software (I mean, `gerrit`) and especially not submit to GitHub/GitLab style of 'one idea is one branch' model, so I'm sort of stuck here with arc. [agit-workflow in forgejo](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/) looks better than GitHub/GitLab, but I'm yet to test them substantially.
