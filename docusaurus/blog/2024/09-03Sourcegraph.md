# SourceGraph and open source

SourceGraph has gone one step further than Elastic[^1]/HashiCorp/MongoDB/etc, and
[even stopped being "open core"](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot/commit/c864f15af264f0f456a6d8a83290b5c940715349).

Wow, just wow. Getting the sweet part of open source, and then pretend as if
they are still open source (by using non-open-license), then now go completely
closed source. Brilliant.

And given that this is not something to celebrate, there's no [blog post](https://sourcegraph.com/blog)
or whatsoever about this on their blog or social media.
(I just skimmed blog titles, and twitter non-reply tweets.)

    To Elastic's defense, as of 2024-08-30, they stated
    they'll add [AGPL](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-is-open-source-again)
    as a license option, becoming "open source" again. This has not happened as
