# GDPR

Some people (mostly provider from EU [^1] where GDPR is their law) asks me to
comply with GDPR in my services; while their law states their law extends to me
for the reason that I may happen to handle EU person's data, that does not make
sense to me because it is too wide of an extraterritorial application of law,
and that I already have my own 'Personal Information Protection Act' in my
country, since 2012.

Also, most of my service is generally targeted at Korean people, and rest of the
World is accepted just because there are either Korean (either as a nationality,
or as a spoken language) is present everywhere â€” and I also travel outside Korea.
After all, EU has no means to force me to court in EU country and face penalty,
other than by my voluntary submission.

So my stance on GDPR is: while I mostly accept the principle of GDPR (excluding
that fucked up bullshit cookie notice), I refuse to be bound by EU law.
If you want to exercise your privacy right, you will need to cite Korean Personal
Information Privacy Act clauses, and use K-PIPA forms and procedures to get it done.
(Note [PIPA is GDPR adequate](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022D0254)
as of the publication of this post.)

    in this page, the word 'EU' includes UK because brexit provisions made
    [EU GDPR into UK domestic law](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-the-eu/overview-data-protection-and-the-eu/#GDPR).
