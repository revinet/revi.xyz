# Moving away from Twyne

Blog is now hosted on [omg.lol's blog (well, weblog) service](https://home.omg.lol/info/weblog) instead of [Twyne](https://github.com/samwilson/twyne/). I really prefer twyne (for ability to embed GPS coord and map data, overland support), but for some foreseeable future, I need to reduce amount of server running (because I won't be able to apply security updates in a timely manner), and therefore I'm turning off the twyne server and using omg.lol for now. I probably should run a total backup of old twyne server before moving completely though....

EDIT (2024-06-08): I migrated once again, now utilizing [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).
