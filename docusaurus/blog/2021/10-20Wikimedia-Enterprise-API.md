# Feeling about Wikimedia Enterprise API

Two stuff in mind:

1. I dunno how sustainable it is, given those rich enough to pay for that
   _Enterprise API_ also has enough money to hire the human to replace
   Enterprise API.
2. I don't want WMF to profit from my work without doing enough in return to the
   editor, who gives them the chance to earn that `$$$`.
