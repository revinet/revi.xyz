# email domains

If you are redirected to this page, you were trying to access web page for
my email-only domains.

These email-only domains only send email from authorized people
(mostly me, my family members, some close friends of mine, and some
project-related people) and their emails are properly authenticated with SPF
and DKIM, and enforced via DMARC
(most of the domains have `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` policy).

As of 2024-09-09, I send emails from following providers:

- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/)
  (forwarding only)
- [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com/)
- [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)
- [Postmark](https://www.postmarkapp.com/)

## Abuse

However, if you received unauthorized emails from domains which connections are
redirected to this page, [contact me](../contact-method) and I'll investigate.

:::warning[Full email headers required]

You need to supply full header and texts for me to investigate.
