# List archive policy

Public forums, which include all developer and user mailing lists, wikis, and
issue reporting systems, are essential to me. I strive to do my work in public
forums in a spirit of transparency and openness where appropriate. They are my
preferred means of communication. Users should understand that communications
they send to such forums may be available to the public for eternity.

Maintaining a publicly-accessible archive of those communications is a vital
component of the services I provide to my friends. They serve as both a public
historical record and a searchable repository of my activities and decisions.

On very rare occasions it becomes necessary to make modifications to my own
archives. This document describes the circumstances and procedures under which
such modifications may happen. Note, though, that many others not affiliated
with me provide archives of my public forums as well. This document pertains
solely to the archives made directly available through hosts controlled by me.

## Disclaimer

All communication sent to my public forums - the public mailing lists, wikis,
issue reporting systems and any other contribution mechanism - is deemed to be
published by the sender of that communication and made public without
conditions. Any disclaimers that may be attached to said communication that
describe it as private or non-redistributable are self-contradictory and thus
null and void. I am not responsible for removing or otherwise concealing your
communication after you caused it to become public.

## Circumstances for Archive modifications

I generally only consider requests to edit or excise material contained in the
archive when the sender of the archived communication makes the request. I
consider each case on its individual merit, and weigh each proposed modification
against the damage done by altering the historical record.

<!-- We deny many more requests than we approve in order to protect the integrity of the archives. -->

I usually edit or remove information only in the event of an inadvertent
disclosure of confidential information, such as a social security number. A
sender's contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) does not
fall into that category. I most certainly do not edit the archives as a means of
reducing one's exposure to spam.

Even if I do modify the archives, numerous third parties independently archive
nearly all of my public mailing lists. If you are seeking to remove an email,
for example, you would to request each of those third parties to edit their
archives, and they may or may not honor such requests. In other words, even if I
were convinced to edit my archives, that wouldn't be very effective.

Be aware that by requesting a modification to the archives you are drawing
attention to whatever information you wish to be kept private. In most
circumstances, by far the most effective course of action is to change anything
that genuinely needs to be changed (such as passwords) and move on.

To clarify, the following examples do not qualify as exceptional circumstances,
and do not merit editing the archives:

- Posting from a wrong email address.
- Posting login names and passwords.
- Posting IP addresses, machine names and/or URLs not intended for public use.
