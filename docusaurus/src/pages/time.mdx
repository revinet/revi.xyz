# What time is it in revi's timezone?

import Clock from '@site/src/components/timer'; // Import the Clock component
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

:::info

This clock works via the client-side JavaScript.
If you disabled it, it might not work correctly.
(I haven't tested no-JavaScript env, so I don't know for sure.)

<Clock />

<!-- When you update timezone here...
update ../src/components/timer/index.js as well. -->

To check the timezone differences with your timezone,
