[my pronouns.page profile](https://en.pronouns.page/@revi) interpretation:

- By default, use `he/him`.
- If we are close enough (as determined by ME), I believe pronouns stop meaning that much to me (see [remarks below](#remarks)), and therefore you have my blessing to use either one of `he/him`, `she/her`, or `they/them` as you feel like.
  - I still find it hard to get used to the new-ish pronouns like `ze` which is confusing to me (at best), so I ask you NOT to use it.
  - Basic rule of thumb is, if you have to ask yourself or me if we are close enough, you are not.
  - If you think we are 'close enough' but not completely sure, you can just ask and I'll make the determination for you.

### Remarks

Korean language does not make use of pronouns that much when it comes to referring someone else (our names are generally short enough that does not need any compression - we can just refer to someone else by `$firstname` prepended by gender-neutral form of sir/madam.) so I find English pronouns to be a bit confusing. This means it might be confusing both to me and to you. Sorry if you are confused.
