These are the best way to contact me.

## Email

For a longer-form message (more than 5-10 chat messages in a batch), email me at `revi@omglol.email`. However, try other medium below if your message is questions or other messages, as it takes a bit of time to read your email.

If your topic is about wiki (wikimedia, mediawiki, or other non-Wikimedia wikis), you may want to email `revi@revi.wiki` instead of the general mailbox.

### Encryption

Use the key in [homepage](/) for gnupg encryption. Both keys work.

If you don't understand what it means, [click here](https://keybase.io/encrypt), type `revi` for recipient, and type your message and 'encrypt' it.

You'll get a box starting with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`. Copy and paste it.

Don't touch anything inside between that BEGIN message and `-----END PGP MESSAGE-----`. Doing so will break the message.

## Discord

Join [my personal discord server](https://revi.xyz/discord) and DM the one with `revi` role at the top.

## IRC

:::info[Deprecated]

As of 2024, I am not really active on IRC. Do not rely on IRC to contact me.

:::

I am `revi` on Libera.chat and [LizardIRC](https://lizardirc.org).

## Matrix

:::info[Notifications may not arrive]

Due to iOS notification issue, message notification on iOS is a hit and miss. Don't rely on Matrix when sending critical message.

:::

You can message me via Matrix at [@revi:omg.lol](https://matrix.to/#/@revi:omg.lol).

I used to have some other identities like `revi@revi.chat` or `revi@revi.xyz`. They no longer work.

## Telegram/Signal

If you already have this contact method, you are free to contact me via these messengers but they are deprecated and should not be relied on.

## Phone numbers

I only share my phone number to those I can (highly) trust.
