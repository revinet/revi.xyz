# How to contact me

These are the recommended way to contact me.

## Email {#email}

::::tip

<Tabs lazy>
<TabItem value="general" label="general" default>

For a longer-form message (more than 5-10 chat messages in a batch),
email me at the address below.

:::info[Email address]

First, visit [this page](https://go.dev/play).

Then, paste the code below to the yellow edit box,
and click the "Run" at right side.

```go title="main.go"
// SPDX-SnippetBegin

// SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

package main

import "fmt"

func ReverseRunes(s string) string {
  r := []rune(s)
  for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < len(r)/2; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
  }
  return string(r)
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(ReverseRunes("liame.iver@nowey"))
}
// SPDX-SnippetEnd
```

Grey box below the yellow edit box will emit the correct email address and say
`Program exited`. ([Example here](https://revi.xyz/img/emailexample.png).

you may want to email me at the address below, instead of the general mailbox.

### Email addresses

Over time, I have used multiple email addresses. If you are not certain if that
email address is controlled by me, use this list to verify it is indeed mine.

### Encryption {#encryption}

Use the key in [OpenPGP page](../pgp/) for gnupg encryption. Both keys work.

If you don't understand what it means, [click here](https://encrypt.to/0x12DD5306418C8E0A8F55761D1EB4F6CEEA100E94),
type your message and send it. If you do not include your email address, I will
not be able to respond to you.

## Discord {#discord}

Join [my personal discord server](https://revi.xyz/discord) and DM the one
with `revi` role at the top.

## IRC {#irc}

:::info[Deprecated]

As of 2024, I am not really active on IRC. Do not rely on IRC to contact me.

:::

I am `revi` on Libera.chat and [LizardIRC](https://lizardirc.org).

## Matrix {#matrix}

:::info[Notifications may not arrive]

Due to iOS notification issue, message notification on iOS is a hit and miss.
Don't rely on Matrix when sending critical message.

:::

You can message me via Matrix at [@revi:silicon.moe](https://matrix.to/#/@revi:silicon.moe).

I used to have some other identities like `@revi:revi.chat`, `@revi:revi.xyz`,
or `@revi:omg.lol`. They no longer work.

## Telegram/Signal {#telegramsignal}

If you already have this contact method, you are free to contact me via these
messengers but they are deprecated and should not be relied on.

### Telegram {#telegram}

- I do not use [Telegram](https://telegram.org) as a regular messenger,
  most of the time.
  - I probably will not notice your private messages.
- If you need to contact me, select from other options above.
- I may participate in group chats, but I might not see your reply.
- I use telegram only for home automation notifications as it is the one of the
  only messenger that has proper multi-device support with push notifications.

## Phone numbers {#phone-numbers}

I only share my phone number to those I can (highly) trust.
