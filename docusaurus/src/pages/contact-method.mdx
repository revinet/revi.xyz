# How to contact me

These are the best way to contact me.

## Email {#email}

::::tip

<Tabs lazy>
<TabItem value="general" label="general" default>

For a longer-form message (more than 5-10 chat messages in a batch),
email me at the address below. However, try other medium below if your message
is questions or other messages, as it takes a bit of time to read your email.

:::info[Email address]

First, visit [this page](https://go.dev/play).

Then, paste the code below to the yellow edit box,
and click the "Run" at right side.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func ReverseRunes(s string) string {
  r := []rune(s)
  for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < len(r)/2; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
  }
  return string(r)
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(ReverseRunes("liame.lolgmo@iver"))
}
```

Grey box below the yellow edit box will emit the correct email address and say
`Program exited`. ([Example here](https://revi.xyz/img/emailexample.png). The source code is from [go.dev](https://go.googlesource.com/example/+/refs/heads/master/hello/reverse/reverse.go)
and licensed under a [BSD license](https://go.dev/LICENSE).)
You can also [click this link](https://go.dev/play/p/BHzsdvrB2rH) to get this prefilled.
Just click the "Run" button.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wiki" label="wiki">

If your topic is about wiki (wikimedia, mediawiki, or other non-Wikimedia wikis),
you may want to email me at the address below, instead of the general mailbox.

:::info[Email address]

First, visit [this page](https://go.dev/play),
Then, paste the code below to the yellow edit box,
and click the "Run" at right side.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func ReverseRunes(s string) string {
  r := []rune(s)
  for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < len(r)/2; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
  }
  return string(r)
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(ReverseRunes("ikiw.iver@iver"))
}
```

### Encryption {#encryption}

Use the key in [homepage](./) for gnupg encryption. Both keys work.

If you don't understand what it means, [click here](https://keybase.io/encrypt),
type `revi` for recipient, and type your message and 'encrypt' it.

You'll get a box starting with `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`. Copy and paste it.

Don't touch anything inside between that BEGIN message and
`-----END PGP MESSAGE-----`. Doing so will break the message.

## Discord {#discord}

Join [my personal discord server](https://revi.xyz/discord) and DM the one
with `revi` role at the top.

## IRC {#irc}

:::info[Deprecated]

As of 2024, I am not really active on IRC. Do not rely on IRC to contact me.

:::

I am `revi` on Libera.chat and [LizardIRC](https://lizardirc.org).

## Matrix {#matrix}

:::info[Notifications may not arrive]

Due to iOS notification issue, message notification on iOS is a hit and miss.
Don't rely on Matrix when sending critical message.

:::

You can message me via Matrix at [@revi:omg.lol](https://matrix.to/#/@revi:omg.lol).

I used to have some other identities like `revi@revi.chat` or `revi@revi.xyz`.
They no longer work.

## Telegram/Signal {#telegramsignal}

If you already have this contact method, you are free to contact me via these
messengers but they are deprecated and should not be relied on.

### Telegram {#telegram}

- I do not use [Telegram](https://telegram.org) as a regular messenger,
  most of the time.
  - I probably will not notice your private messages.
- If you need to contact me, select from other options above.
- I may participate in group chats, but I might not see your reply.
- I use telegram only for home automation notifications as it is the one of the
  only messenger that has proper multi-device support with push notifications.

## Phone numbers {#phone-numbers}

I only share my phone number to those I can (highly) trust.
