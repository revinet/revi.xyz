# About this site

This site is statically generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io),
and deployed via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

There's additional docs about process @ [GitHub](https://github.com/revinet/revi.xyz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Build {#build}

1. I push new commit to [GitHub](https://github.com/revinet/revi.xyz).
2. GitHub Actions will decide if there's any changes to `docusaurus/` directory
   or `package.json` in the `master` branch.
3. GitHub Actions will trigger the build, if any of them are found.
4. When docusaurus build succeeds, it will be uploaded to Cloudflare Pages via
   `wrangler` for [direct upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/#deploy-your-assets)
   at test domain.
5. When I am satisfied with the contents, I push to `prod` branch,
   which will do the same as `4` but for `revi.xyz` production domain.

The reason I use GitHub Actions for build command (not the Cloudflare's build server)
is that I can move repository to other git forge (or other repository) at any
time - I just need to port the build script to use new CI server.

When I use Cloudflare's GitHub connection with Cloudflare Build server,
I am bound to that single repository, which is not really desirable.

When the new revision is landed on `master`, a set of CI tests are run on them,
for example prettier syntax check, LightHouse CI run (for fun, because Chromium
support is NOT a priority to me), and playwright tests to verify page renders
same as I expect.

## Resources {#resources}

This site relies on these 3rd party resources.

### Fonts {#fonts}

I deliberately load webfonts, because most non-Korean readers will not have
decent Korean fonts in their systems, and I'd like a consistent font display
for everyone.
