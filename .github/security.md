# Security Policy

## Contact these peoples for software issues

So, if you have found out vulnerability on `revi.xyz` server?

That is not something I can work on. Contact [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).
They run the infrastructure on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

Otherwise, I use [these software](https://github.com/revinet/revi.xyz/blob/master/package-lock.json).
It's likely that the problem you discovered is their problem, not mine.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

After reading above, if you are still certain if you discovered a security bug
that falls within MY responsibility, then contact me.

Use the contact details at [security.txt](https://revi.xyz/.well-known/security.txt).
